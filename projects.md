Here's a few projects I have worked on in the past!

## RNPFind
`rnpfind` is a bioinformatics tool that collects and visualizes interaction
data between RNA molecules and proteins. It's really helpful for RNA biologists
that might be looking for explanations for certain phonemena of interest, like:
"which proteins might be involved in binding to a particular area of my RNA
molecule?". Because RNA molecules are so involved in _everything_ (think
cancer), their
interactions with proteins is of utmost importance!

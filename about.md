I am a bioinformatics research assistant at Qatar Computing Research Institute.
Before getting here I graduated from Carnegie Mellon Univesity with degrees in
Computer Science and Biological Sciences.

# Biologist in love with math
My childhood has been defined by a deep fascination and
love for math. As my math professor used to say: "The universe may die one day
but mathematical truths; mathematical truths are eternal truths!". I feel
blessed to be a part of a species that gained the consciousness necessary to
realize these truths (yes, I can't get over the fact that the square root of 2
is _provably_ irrational, can you?).


# Chess player
Sometimes (very often) I like to play chess online! I used to play sometimes
when I was young but I never realized it was a deep and well studied field in
its own right; I just love the fact that there have been studies of this game
for so many centuries that are relevant to this day. I enjoy watching videos
about historical chess figures and theories on openings and endgames; the
recent developments in artificial intelligence are also really interesting and
very telling of our relationship with computers.

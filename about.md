I am a MSc student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/) studying Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.
I am interested in multimodal learning in the context of health care. This includes representation learning and generative modelling.
Currently, I am writing my masters thesis at the [Biomedical Informatics Lab](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch) on this topic.

Before getting here, I was a bioinformatics research assistant at Qatar
Computing Research Institute. There, I contributed to many different projects,
including finding [novel genetic variants that affect ECG derived quantities](https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038341).

I graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) with BSc degrees
in [Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) and [Biological
Sciences](https://cmu.edu/mcs). I was recognized as an [Andrew Carnegie
Scholar](https://www.cmu.edu/engage/give/donor-recognition/andrew-carnegie-society/acs-scholars)
for my academic achievements and was a [Fifth Year Scholar](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/get-involved/fifth-year/index.html).

# Love for math
My childhood has been defined by a deep fascination and
love for math. As my math professor used to say: "The universe may die one day
but mathematical truths; mathematical truths are eternal truths!". I feel
blessed to be a part of a species that gained the consciousness necessary to
realize these truths (yes, I can't get over the fact that the square root of 2
is _provably_ irrational, can you?).


# Chess player
Sometimes (very often) I like to play chess online! I used to play sometimes
when I was young but I never realized it was a deep and well studied field in
its own right; I just love the fact that there have been studies of this game
for so many centuries that are relevant to this day. I enjoy watching videos
about historical chess figures and theories on openings and endgames; the
recent developments in artificial intelligence are also really interesting and
very telling of our relationship with computers.

Hey there!

I am a MSc student in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/).
My research interests lie in multimodal learning for healthcare, particularly in representation learning and generative modeling.
I am currently completing my master's thesis at the [Biomedical Informatics Lab](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch) on this topic.

Before getting here, I was a bioinformatics research assistant at [Qatar
Computing Research Institute](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri). There, I contributed to several projects,
including finding [novel genetic variants influencing ECG-derived traits](https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.038341).

I hold dual BSc degrees in [Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) and
[Biological Sciences](https://cmu.edu/mcs) from [Carnegie Mellon
University](https://cmu.edu), where I was named an [Andrew Carnegie
Scholar](https://www.cmu.edu/engage/give/donor-recognition/andrew-carnegie-society/acs-scholars)
and selected as a [Fifth Year
Scholar](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/get-involved/fifth-year/index.html)
in recognition of my academic excellence and contributions to the university
community.


# Love for math
My childhood has been defined by a deep fascination and
love for math. As my math professor used to say: "The universe may die one day
but mathematical truths; mathematical truths are eternal truths!". I feel
blessed to be a part of a species that gained the consciousness necessary to
realize these truths (yes, I can't get over the fact that the square root of 2
is _provably_ irrational, can you?).


# Chess player
Sometimes (very often) I like to play chess online! I used to play sometimes
when I was young but I never realized it was a deep and well studied field in
its own right; I just love the fact that there have been studies of this game
for so many centuries that are relevant to this day. I enjoy watching videos
about historical chess figures and theories on openings and endgames; the
recent developments in artificial intelligence are also really interesting and
very telling of our relationship with computers.

# Homepage
My personal homepage, built using the magic of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
Uses the default Minima template that comes shipped with Jekyll, with a few [changes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) to better suit my site.

For local building:
```
[bundle exec] jekyll serve
```
